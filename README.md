# REPO1

I do not understand what Im supposed to do in this repo so ill start messing with everything! CHEERS!!!
Under the actions tab there is a thing that allows me to create a simple workflow and allows me to commit something, considering i dont know what im commiting or how that will alter my github in the future im not going to mess with it but it looks interesting.
